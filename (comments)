To finish, I need to link the sql to the actual table.
Additioanlly, I wouldlike to have the option to arrange the songs alphabetically.
UPDATE: iterm application for sending data fails due to an unknown pathway. I would need to fix this to link the two.
TODO: alphabetical organizer and color code based on style of song
      blue: shuffle
      red: western swing
      green: two beat/train beat
      purple: ballad
      yellow: waltz
      orange: straight
